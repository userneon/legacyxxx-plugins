# Legacy-X rank system (v1.0) — implementation notes

The specification is the design pack's `RANK-SYSTEM.md` (EXP formula, 18 ranks, Pro League 1400/1350).
This page records where each part lives and the choices the spec leaves open.

| Part | Where |
|---|---|
| Ladder (18 ranks, thresholds, image keys), Pro League rule, progress | `server/legacyX/rank/ranks.ts` (+ `legacy_x.competitive_rank_definitions`) |
| ΔEXP formula, validity, leaver, short-handed, participation, bots, calibration, caps, floor | `server/legacyX/rank/exp.ts` (pure, no I/O) |
| Plugin payload → calculation → apply, retry on concurrent change | `server/legacyX/rank/matchResult.ts` |
| Atomic, idempotent apply (receipt by event id), EXP floor, Pro League flag, history rows | `legacy_x.apply_competitive_match_exp` (`supabase/legacy_x_rank_system_v1.sql`) |
| Tests for every rule in the spec | `server/legacyX/rank/*.test.ts` |

Calculation version: `rank-v1.0` (stored on every `competitive_match_exp` row and receipt).

## Choices not fixed by the spec

- **Rounding** is half away from zero, so a gain and the mirrored loss have the same size (the worked example
  gives the same numbers either way).
- **Lobby deviation** is the population standard deviation over every human with at least one round; the floor
  0.05 applies.
- **MVP** is the highest `score` among players whose EXP is performance-based (not leavers, not <50 % players);
  ties all get the bonus; nobody gets it when all of them share one score.
- **Team rating** is the average EXP (at match start) of the team's starters; fills are excluded from it but
  get EXP normally for the rounds they played.
- **Leaver in an invalid match** still gets −25 (the implementation contract keeps the leaver rule for invalid
  matches). Fun Mode is the exception: it never changes EXP, not even for a leaver.
- **Unregistered humans** (no Legacy-X account yet) count in the lobby at the starting 1000 EXP; only
  registered players get history rows.
- **Short-handed rounds** come from the plugin (`short_handed_rounds`); when absent they are derived from the
  leaver's `left_at_round`, but only if no fill joined that team.

## What players see

`GET /api/v1/public/competitive/players/:userId/matches` returns each ranked match with `expDelta` and the
breakdown (`result`, `margin`, `performance`, `bonus`, `calibration`, `reason`, `omittedTerms`), which the website
shows as `+18 · Win vs stronger team +17 · Margin +2 · Performance −1`.

## Daily gain cap (anti-farming)

Limits use Ulaanbaatar time (UTC+8, no daylight saving). A player's first **150 EXP gained in a day** (00:00 to
00:00) count in full. Any gain past that counts for a quarter (a 20 EXP gain becomes 5; a gain that crosses the
line is split: the part under it in full, the rest for a quarter). The **weekly limit is a hard stop**: once a
player has gained **600 EXP in a week** (Monday 00:00 to Sunday night, quarter-value gains included), further
gains are 0 until Monday. `exp_breakdown.limited` is `"daily"` or `"weekly"` on any reduced gain. Losses are
never reduced, and the limits still apply at Legacy so the top of the leaderboard cannot be farmed. Ranks are
never reset. This makes farming with friends (win-trading, feeding kills) slow.
